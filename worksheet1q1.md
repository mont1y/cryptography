# Cryptography Worksheet 1 CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) Question 1 Walkthrough

Consider an encryption scheme where the first bit of a message is equal to the last
bit of its ciphertext.
This encryption scheme is not perfectly secure - show an attack.

#### Semantic Security Game:

In cryptography, a semantic security game is an experiment involving a **challenger** and an **adversary**. The game determines the security of the encryption scheme.

#### Definition of CPA Secure Encryption:
A polynomial time adversary cannot perform a distinguishing attack even if he has the power to choose plaintexts and see their encryptions.

In other words, the challenger encrypts a random message from the messages chosen by the adversary, and the adversary should **not** be able to distinguish which ciphertext corresponds to which message. If the attacker is able to do so accurately, the encryption scheme is not perfectly secure.

### Breakdown

---

### Challenger and Adversary:

The diagram is divided into two columns. The left column (Challenger) represents the encryption process, and the right (Adversary) represents the attacker.

The interaction between them shows a semantic security game, where they exchange messages to test the encryption scheme's security.

### 1. ùëò ‚Üê$ ùêæ

The Challenger selects a random secret key ùëò from the key space ùêæ used to encryption later on. The symbol `‚Üê$` means "select at random from."

### 2. m $_{0}$ ‚Üê 0 || random bits

The adversary constructs a message (plaintext) m $_{0}$ that begins with a 0 bit followed by random bits.

Note: || represents concatenation, meaning the 0 or 1 is joined with a sequence of random bits to form the message

### 3. m $_{1}$ ‚Üê 1 || random bits

The adversary constructs another message m $_{1}$ that begins with a 1 bit followed by random bits.

### 4. Sending the plaintext
Adversary sends the message (plaintext) to the challenger

After constructing the messages m $_{0}$ and m $_{1}$, The adversary sends the message to the attacker.

### 5. c ‚Üê Enc(k,m $_{b}$)

The challenger chooses one of the messages the adversary sends randomly {0 or 1}, and encrypts the messages with the secret key ùëò.

### 6. Sending the ciphertext
Challenger sends the encrypted message (ciphertext) to the adversary

### 7. $ \hat{b} \leftarrow $ 0 if c[-1] = 0 else 1

The adversary tries to guess which message the challenger encrypted.


$ \hat{b} $ represents the bit of the message that the challenger chose at random (i.e. which message the challenger encrypted {0 or 1}).

Since the encryption scheme states that the first bit of a message is equal to the last bit of its ciphertext, we can deduct that, if the last bit of the ciphertext c (denoted by c[-1]) == 0, the message encrypted was m $_{0}$.

Vice versa, if the last bit of the ciphertext c (denoted by c[-1]) == 1, the message encrypted was m $_{1}$.

Therefore,

**SSAdv(A, E) = |Pr[A outputs 1 in experiment 0] ‚àí Pr[A outputs 1 in experiment 1]| = |0 ‚àí 1| = 1**

Breakdown:

The semantic security advantage (**SSAdv**)

of an adversary A against an encryption scheme E (**SSAdv(A,E)**)

is equal to the absolute value of 

the probability of adversary A guesses that the message encrypted was m $_{1}$ when it's actually m $_{0}$ (which is zero, because the adversary can tell which message was encrypted very easily just by looking at the last bit)

minus

the probability of adversary A guesses that the message encrypted was m $_{1}$ when it is indeed m $_{1}$ (which is 100%, or 1)

= 1 (100%)

Since the adversary can distinguish which message was encrypted with an 100% accuracy in polynomial time (The algorithm of distinguishing the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext), we can conclude that the encryption scheme is **not** semantically secure.
