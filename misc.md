A **MAC** (Message Authentication Code) is a small piece of information that’s used to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message. In other words, a MAC ensures that the message has not been tampered with and that it was indeed sent by the correct sender.

How MAC Works:
Generate MAC:

The sender creates a MAC by combining the message with a secret key using a MAC algorithm (e.g., HMAC).
This results in a short, fixed-length code (the MAC) that is sent along with the message.
Verify MAC:

When the receiver gets the message and the MAC, they use the same secret key to generate a MAC on their end.
If the MAC they generate matches the one received, it confirms that the message is authentic and hasn’t been altered.
Key Features of MAC:
Integrity: Any changes to the message would result in a different MAC, allowing the receiver to detect tampering.
Authentication: Only someone with the secret key can generate a valid MAC, confirming the sender’s identity.
