### In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The key is the number of positions used in the left shift. This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

solution:

Send m0 -> AB
send m1 -> AC

if ciphertext's first and second letters are consequtive, m0 was encrypted, otherwise m1
