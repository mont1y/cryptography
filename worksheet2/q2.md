###  Let E be any encryption scheme that takes in a key of length λ and message of length ℓ and produces ciphertexts of length ℓ′. Assume that E is CPA secure. (E might be encryption in CBC mode, as discussed in class.) Now let E′ be an encryption scheme identical to E except with the following modification; it mirrors all of the bits in the output of E (e.g. it swaps c[0] with c[ℓ′ − 1], c[1] with c[ℓ′ − 2] and so on..).

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for block ciphers that enhances security by linking each block of plaintext with the previous ciphertext block.

Enc′(k, m) = mirror(Enc(k, m))

encryption is straightforward, as described in the question

to decrypt the ciphertext, we need to mirror the ciphertext, and then decrypt it with secret key k

Dec′(k, c) = Dec(k, mirror(c))

### Is E′ CPA secure?

yes, because E is CPA secure, mirroring it does not make it unsecure
