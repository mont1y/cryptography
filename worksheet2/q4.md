### Let MAC = (Gen, MAC, Ver) be a secure MAC. Is MAC′ (m) = (m, MAC(m))also a secure MAC? Explain why or why not.

Solution
MAC′ is secure. For a contradiction, suppose MAC′ is not secure. This means that the adversary can construct a valid message-tag pair m∗, t∗ such that t∗ = (m∗, MACk(m∗)). This means that the adversary output a valid message-tag pair for MAC, which is m∗
, MACk(m∗). This is a contradiction
because MAC is secure.
